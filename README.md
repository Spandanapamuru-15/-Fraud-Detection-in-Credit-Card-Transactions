# -Fraud-Detection-in-Credit-Card-Transactions
This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning. Financial fraud is a growing concern, and early detection helps protect both users and institutions. Using an imbalanced dataset (like the one from Kaggle), we apply supervised learning models to distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent transactions.
